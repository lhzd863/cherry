# Cherry doc

``Cherry`` is an application that works through a configuration file. This configuration file has his own way to express things.
This configuration divide stuffs in sections. A section can be understood as:

```
        [section-name] (
            [all configuration stuff goes here]
        )
```

Configurations can have some data types such as strings, alien values, number and booleans. Take a look at the ``Table 1``
to see samples from these data types.

**Table 1**: Data types sample.

| **Data Type** |                                         **Sample**                                         |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   ``String``  |                        "Hey Beavis, I'm a string huh!"                                     |
|   ``Number``  |                              0, 1, 2, 3, 5                                                 |
|   ``Boolean`` |                           yes, no, true, false                                             |
|   ``Alien``   |(Things that requires more explanation in order to express all developer's craziness about) |

All configuration is defined in the ``field = value`` form. Being one configuration (``field-value``) per line.

The main section in a ``cherry configuration file`` is called ``cherry.root`` and until now it only admits one information inside.
This piece of information is the server's hostname. If your server has no name you can use the literal IP address as follows:

```
        cherry.root (
            # This is a comment, sorry I forgot to talk about comments.
            servername = "192.30.70.3"
        )
```

There is a section where you actually open your ``chat rooms``. This section is called ``cherry.rooms``.
There ``alien values`` are needed. This ``alien value`` must be in this form: ``[room_name]:[listen_port]``.
So take a look at the definition sample right below:

        cherry.rooms (
            aliens-on-earth:8810
            foobaroom:8811
            wonkies-lounge:8812
            backyard-science:8813
        )

Each room opened inside ``cherry.rooms`` section features specific sections that must be adjusted in order to be created
at the moment that you run ``Cherry``. The ``Table 2`` summarizes these sections.

**Table 2**: Specific room's sections.

|              **Sections**                      |                    **Used for**                                        |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|       ``cherry.[room-name].template``          |                  templates definition                                  |
|       ``cherry.[room-name].actions``           |                  actions definition                                    |
|       ``cherry.[room-name].actions.templates`` |                  actions templates definition                          |
|       ``cherry.[room-name].images``            |                  images definition                                     |
|    ``cherry.[room-name].images.url``           |                  images resources definition                           |
|        ``cherry.[room-name].misc``             |                  generic configurations for this room                  |

All information inside ``Table 2`` must be a mess for you. For this reason, firstly, we need to understand some concepts:
``templates``, ``actions``, ``images`` and ``misc configs``.

## What are templates?

Templates can be understood as ``HTML`` data bringing some special makers which are processed (expanded) before sent. When
sent it means sent to the room clients. These special markers on ``Cherry`` are delimited by ``{{.`` and ``}}``. ``Table 3``
summarizes each special marker supported until now.

**Table 3**: Special markers.

|               **Marker**                       |                         **Expanded for**                               |
|:----------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|            ``{{.nickname}}``                   |                      The user's nickname                               |
|            ``{{.session-id}}``                 |                      The user's session-id                             |
|            ``{{.color}}``                      |                      The user nickname's color code                    |
|            ``{{.ignorelist}}``                 |                      Users that one user are ignoring                  |
|            ``{{.hour}}``                       |                      The current server hour                           |

|          ``{{.brief-users-total}}``            |                      The users total (well formatted)                  |

|          ``{{.proto}}``                        |                      The current used url scheme (http or https)       |

## What are actions?

Actions are the ways how users can communicate each other. Your chat room for example can admit that a user: "talks", "screams" and "mutters".

The way to define it for a room is as follows:

```
        cherry.aliens-on-earth.actions (
            a01 = "talks"
            a02 = "screams"
            a03 = "mutters"
            a04 = "(IGNORE)"
            a05 = "(STOP IGNORE)"
        )

```

Each action definition should be: ``<action-identifier> = <action label string>``.

Depending on action it is possible to format the message in a specific way. For this reason there is another section
called ``cherry.[room-name].actions.templates`` where this must be defined.

```
        cherry.aliens-on-earth.actions.templates (
            a01 = "aliens-on-earth/templates/actions/a01.html"
            a02 = "aliens-on-earth/templates/actions/a02.html"
            a03 = "aliens-on-earth/templates/actions/a03.html"
            a04 = "aliens-on-earth/templates/actions/a04.html"
            a05 = "aliens-on-earth/templates/actions/a05.html"
        )
```

Each action template definition should be: ``<action-identifier-previous-defined-inside-actions> = <string path to a HTML template>``.

## What are images?

Similar to the ``actions`` the ``images`` are labels which the user can choose inside a combo when sending messages. This message
when formatted will include an well-known image. Usually an image should be tematic. Well, things like smiles, emojis, etc.

The images are configured using two sections. The first one defines the identifiers and their labels.

```
        cherry.aliens-on-earth.images (
            i01 = "glad"
            i02 = "mad"
            i03 = "abducted"
        )
```

Now with the identifiers and labels properly defined it is necessary indicate the URL from each resource (an image in this case).

```
        cherry.aliens-on-earth.images.url (
            i01 = "http://www.nasa.org/chat51/glad.gif"
            i02 = "http://www.nasa.org/chat51/mad.gif"
            i03 = "http://www.nasa.org/chat51/abducted.gif"
        )
```

## What about the misc config?

Misc configurations are generic configurations for a specific room. It can be accessed from section called: ``cherry.[room-name].misc``.
Take a look at the ``Table 4`` in order to see what can be configured in this section.

|      **Configuration**                   |               **What it does**                             |  **Data type**     |
|:----------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------:|
|       ``join-message``                   | Defines a message that is displayed when a new user joins  |      ``string``    |
|       ``exit-message``                   | Defines a message that is displayed when a user exits      |      ``string``    |
|       ``on-ignore-message``              | Message that confirms an ignore action                     |      ``string``    |
|       ``on-deignore-message``            | Message that confirms a (de)ignore action                  |      ``string``    |
|       ``greeting-message``               | Defines a greeting message                                 |      ``string``    |
|       ``private-message-maker``          | Defines a string that indicates a private message          |      ``string``    |
|       ``max-users``                      | Defines the maximum of users allowed for this room         |      ``number``    |
|       ``allow-brief``                    | Defines if briefs are allowed or not                       |      ``boolean``   |
|       ``all-users-alias``                | Defines the alias which represents everybody in the room   |      ``string``    |
|       ``ignore-action``                  | Defines the action-id used as ignore command               |      ``string``    |
|       ``deignore-action``                | Defines the action-id used as (de)ignore commnad           |      ``string``    |
|       ``public-directory``               | Defines a relative directory path that gathers public data |      ``string``    |

Follows a definition sample:

```
        cherry.aliens-on-earth.misc (
            join-message = "joined..."
            exit-message = "has left..."
            on-ignore-message = "(only you can see this) is ignoring "
            on-deignore-message = "(only you can see this) is not ignoring "
            greeting-message = "welcome"
            private-message-marker = "(private)"
            max-users = 10
            allow-brief = yes
            all-users-alias = "EVERYBODY"
            ignore-action = "a04"
            deignore-action = "a05"
        )
```

When you do not specify any value for ``public-directory`` your room will not have a public folder with files that can be accessed by anyone.

However, if you want to define a public directory for your room, this directory needs to be relative to your execution path. Supposing that ``cherry`` will be executed from
``~/web/git-hub/rafael-santiago/cherry/sample``, then the public directory needs to be under this path. For instance:

```
doctor@TARDIS:~/web/git-hub/rafael-santiago/cherry/sample# mkdir pubdata
doctor@TARDIS:~/web/git-hub/rafael-santiago/cherry/sample# ls
conf/   templates/   pubdata/
doctor@TARDIS:~/web/git-hub/rafael-santiago/cherry/sample#_
```

Now, inside the ``misc`` section we will indicate the ``pubdata`` directory as our (relative) ``public-directory``, so:

```
        cherry.aliens-on-earth.misc (
            join-message = "joined..."
            exit-message = "has left..."
            on-ignore-message = "(only you can see this) is ignoring "
            on-deignore-message = "(only you can see this) is not ignoring "
            greeting-message = "welcome"
            private-message-marker = "(private)"
            max-users = 10
            allow-brief = yes
            all-users-alias = "EVERYBODY"
            ignore-action = "a04"
            deignore-action = "a05"
            public-directory = "pubdata"
        )
```

Beware about two things:

1. All data put under this public path will be public to anyone.
2. Until now only few things could be served from this directory: images (``gif``, ``jpeg``, ``bmp``, ``png``) and ``plain/text`` data.

## Some tricks

It is not a good practice define the entire configuration in just one file. The ``Cherry`` configuration's language implements
support for code "importation". The way to do it is:

```
        #
        # "cherry.config"
        # Description: the main configuration file.
        #

        cherry.branch aliens-on-earth.config
        cherry.branch backyard-science.config
        cherry.branch wonkies-lounge.config
```

Congrats, now your ``Cherry`` tree has branches! :) Cut off one branch from it is pretty simple, just comment it.
In the sample case above as effect a room will stop being created.

### Adding images to your messages

It is possible adding the ``image reference`` to your message. Here an ``image reference`` can be understood as an ``URI``
enclosed with square backets.

Take a look:

``Hey Beavis! Look a cool message Huh! [https://image.com/somewhere/over/the/rainbow/yourimage.gif]``

When it is sent the server can automatically include the image content inside the message content.

## Opening your first chat room

I know is rather confuse read this kind of descriptions without any concrete example. From now on we will compose each
document necessary to create a chat room.

For this part is essential not be a ``chickenshit`` and remember:

![We can do it](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/cherry/blob/master/etc/wecan.jpg)

On ``Cherry`` there are 3 kinds of documents (HTML documents):

1. The join form (where the user chooses his nickname and color for it).
2. The chat room (with 3 parts: top, body and banner).
3. The post-exit ``HTML`` document.

### Configuration overview

The directory structure that will be used for this sample is:

```
        sample/
                conf/
                templates/
```

Firstly, we need to compose our config file. The file where we actually open our rooms.

The config files will be within ``conf`` subdirectory and we will open just one chat room called ``aliens-on-earth``.
The configuration is splitted in two files:


```
        # "sample.cherry"
        #
        # This config file shows how to open a room using cherry.

        cherry.root (
            # Actually it will be accessible locally only.
            servername = "localhost"
        )

        cherry.rooms (
            aliens-on-earth:1024
        )

        cherry.branch conf/aliens_on_earth.cherry
```

and

```
        # "aliens_on_earth.cherry"
        #
        # Aliens on earth room config.

        cherry.aliens-on-earth.templates (
            top = "templates/top/0.html"
            body = "templates/body/0.html"
            banner = "templates/banner/0.html"
            highlight = "templates/highlight/0.html"
            entrance = "templates/entrance/0.html"
            exit = "templates/exit/0.html"
            nickclash = "templates/nickclash/0.html"
            skeleton = "templates/skeleton/0.html"
            brief = "templates/brief/0.html"
            find-results-head = "templates/find/h0.html"
            find-results-body = "templates/find/b0.html"
            find-results-tail = "templates/find/t0.html"
            find-bot = "templates/find/fb0.html"
        )

        cherry.aliens-on-earth.actions (
            a01 = "talks to"
            a02 = "screams with"
            a03 = "IGNORE"
            a04 = "NOT IGNORE"
        )

        cherry.aliens-on-earth.actions.templates (
            a01 = "templates/actions/a01.html"
            a02 = "templates/actions/a02.html"
            a03 = "templates/actions/a01.html"
            a04 = "templates/actions/a01.html"
        )

        cherry.aliens-on-earth.misc (
            join-message = "joined...<script>scrollIt();</script>"
            exit-message = "has left...<script>scrollIt();</script>"
            on-ignore-message = "(only you can see it) IGNORING "
            on-deignore-message = "(only you can see it) is NOT IGNORING "
            greeting-message = "Take me to your leader!!!"
            private-message-marker = "(private)"
            max-users = 10
            allow-brief = yes
            all-users-alias = "EVERYBODY"
            ignore-action = "a03"
            deignore-action = "a04"
        )
```

As you can see in ``cherry.root`` section from ``sample.cherry`` file the chat rooms will be locally accessible only.
The reason is the usage of "localhost" as ``servername``.

The room ``aliens-on-earth`` is being served at port ``1024``.

Looking inside the file ``aliens_on_earth.cherry`` you will see several templates path indication in ``cherry.aliens-on-earth.templates``.
This room only admits four actions according to ``cherry.aliens-on-earth.actions`` section. The room can support ten simultaneous users.

I judge that the remaining configuration data is pretty self-explanatory.

What really needs attention are the templates. This is the heart and soul of any room that you create using ``Cherry``.

### Detailing the used templates

As said some lines ago templates are ``HTML`` files carrying some ``special markers``. This markers are processed (expanded) before
sending.

You can compose your templates by your own taste. However, depending on template purpose, there are some markers that you will always use.

#### The join template

In order to create a join template (a ``HTML`` file that will be returned when user request the virtual document called ``join``)
it is necessary define a form action pointing to ``http://{{.server}}:{{.listen-port}}/join`` with a ``post`` method.

The fields that need to be posted are: ``says`` (containing anything), ``user`` (containing the nickname), ``color`` (containg values between ``0`` and ``7`` inclusive).

Follows an example:

```html
        <html>
            <title>Room entrance</title>
            <body>
                <h1>Aliens on earth</h1><br><br><br>
                <center><small>take me to your leader...</small></center>
                <form action="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/join" method="post" target="_top">
                    <input type="hidden" name="says" value="joined..."><br><br><br><br>
                    <p align="center">
                        <table cellpadding="0" border="0">
                            <tr>
                                <td>
                                    <b>Nickname</b>
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    <b>Color</b>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>
                                    <input type = "text" name = "user" value = "">
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    <select name = "color" value = "">
                                        <option value = "0">black
                                        <option value = "1">red
                                        <option value = "2">green
                                        <option value = "3">gray
                                        <option value = "4">purple
                                        <option value = "5">pink
                                        <option value = "6">blue
                                        <option value = "7">cyan
                                    </select>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td></td>
                                <td>
                                    <input type = "submit" size=30 value="join"><br>
                                    <a href = "http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/brief">Brief</a><br>
                                    <a href = "http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/find">Search</a>
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </p>
                </form>
            </body>
        </html>
```

Note that were also added links to the room's ``brief`` and server's ``find``.

#### The brief template

The ``brief`` template counts with three important ``markers``. The ``Table 5`` bring more details about them.

|         **Brief marker**            |                          **Handy for**                             |
|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| ``{{.brief-last-public-messages}}`` | Showing (well-formatted) the last ten public messages in a room    |
|      ``{{.brief-users-total}}``     | Showing the connected user total on the processing moment          |
|   ``{{.brief-who-are-talking}}``    | Showing a nickname listing based on who are currently connected on |

Look a sample:

```html
        <html>

            <h1>What is going on at {{.room-name}}...</h1>

            <frame>
                {{.brief-last-public-messages}}
            </frame>

            <br><br>

            <b>This room has {{.brief-users-total}} connected user(s)</b>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Who are talking...</h3>

            {{.brief-who-are-talking}}

            <br><br>

            <a href = "http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/join">Join</a>

        </html>
```

For navigation convenience in the sample a link to the join form was added to the brief document.

#### The find template

The find template is pretty simple. This must bring a form with ``action`` ponting to ``http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/find`` (yes, this is a little bit weird, because the search echoes to all existing rooms) and the ``HTTP method`` must be a ``post``.
This document has to post only one field that is ``user``. This field is carried with the desired nickname pattern.

Yes, a sample:

```html
        <html>
            <h1>Search for user...</h1>
            <form action="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/find" method="post" target="_top">
                <table border = 0>
                    <tr><td><b>Nickname</b></td><td><input type="text" size=100 name="user"></td></tr>
                    <tr><td></td><td><input type="submit" value="search"></td></tr>
                </table>
            </form>
        </html>
```

### Adding the chat room brief support to your server

The brief template is very straightforward too. Here is included in the ``HTML`` contents the following pieces of information:

- the room name
- the last public messages (not send in private mode)
- the total of connected users
- the user list
- a link in order to join in this room

All that was said above is here in ``HTML``:

```html
        <html>

            <h1>What is going on at {{.room-name}}...</h1>

            <frame>
                {{.brief-last-public-messages}}
            </frame>

            <br><br>

            <b>This room has {{.brief-users-total}} connected user(s)</b>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Who are talking...</h3>

            {{.brief-who-are-talking}}

            <br><br>

            <a href = "http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/join">Join</a>

        </html>
```

### Adding user find support to your server

The find feature is a little bit more complicated than others. In the find feature we need to define four templates:

1. a template that stands for the ``find bot``
2. a template that includes the result's ``header data``
3. a template that includes the result's ``body data``
4. a template that includes the result's ``tail data``

The secret behind the ``find bot`` is define a post form with action at ``http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/find/``.
This post must submit only one piece of information that is ``user``. So now we will translated it into ordinary ``HTML``:

```html
        <html>
            <h1>Search for user...</h1>
            <form action="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/find" method="post" target="_top">
                <table border = 0>
                    <tr><td><b>Nickname</b></td><td><input type="text" size=100 name="user"></td></tr>
                    <tr><td></td><td><input type="submit" value="search"></td></tr>
                </table>
            </form>
        </html>
```

The result's header data is the highest information that will be included in a find result report. Nothing so special, look:

```html
        <html>
            <h1>Find results</h1>
            <table border = 0>
                <tr><td><b>Nickname</b></td><td><b>Room</b></td><td><b>Users total</b></td><td><b>Join</b></td><td><b>Brief</b></td></tr>
```

Remember that this is incomplete because it needs to the result's body data:

```html
    <tr><td>{{.find-result-user}}</td><td>{{.find-result-room-name}}</td><td>{{.find-result-users-total}}</td><td><a href="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/join">Join</a></td><td><a href="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/brief">Brief</a></td></tr>
```

Note that inside template shown above we are including some important expansive data in order to populate our ``HTML`` table with interesting data:

- The found user (``{{.find-result-user}}``)
- The room where this user is actually talking (``{{.find-result-room-name}}``)
- The total of users in this room (``{{.find-results-users-total}}``)
- A convinient link to join or spy the room: ``http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/join``, ``http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/brief``

However, this template is incomplete because it needs to have the populated table closed. We do this in the result's tail:

```html
    </table>
</html>
```

Done.

### The top template

The top template stands for the highest frame composing a room.

Here follows a sample:

```html
        <html>
            <head></head>
            <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">
                <table cellpadding="0" cellpadding="2" border="0" width="100%" valign="top">
                    <tr valign="top"><td valign="top">
                        <b>{{.room-name}}</b><br><br>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <center><small>QoTD: {{.greeting-message}}</small></center>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <center>
                            <form name="chatconfig">
                                <input type="checkbox" name="autoscroll" value="1" unchecked>
                                <i>autoscroll</i>
                            </form>
                        </center>
                    </td></tr>
                </table>
            </body>
        </html>
```

The only special thing here (non mandatory) is the form ``chatconfig`` definition. We will use this for auto scrolling. However, this is just a trick not a feature.

### The body template

This template stands for the frame from the middle in the room's structure. In this frame we will see all the messages.

Sample:

```html
<script>
    function scrollIt() {
        if (top.TOP.document.chatconfig.autoscroll.checked) {
            setTimeout("window.scroll(0, 1000000);", 100);
        }
    }

</script>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">
<p>
<p>
<p>
```

Note that the ``JS`` function ``scrollIt()`` checks if the checkbox present in the form ``chatconfig`` is checked before scrolling.

### The banner template

Maybe this is the most complicated room structure template. Anyway, this template must define a post form with target at ``http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/banner``.

The posted fields are:

- ``user`` (``{{.nickname}}``)
- ``id`` (``{{.id}}``)
- ``image`` (not included here but will be explained after)
- ``priv`` (``{{.priv}}``)
- ``action`` (a ``select input`` composed by the server listing the actions)
- ``whoto`` (a ``select input`` composed by the server listing the users)
- ``says`` (a ``text input`` where you will type your messages)

```html
        <html>
            <head></head>
            <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" onload="setfocus()">
                <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="100%" valign="top">
                    <tr valign="top"><td valign="top">
                        <form method="post" action="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/banner&user={{.nickname}}&id={{.session-id}}&" name="banner">
                            <input type="hidden" name="user" value="{{.nickname}}">
                            <input type="hidden" name="id" value="{{.session-id}}">
                            <input type="hidden" name="image" value="">
                            {{.nickname}}<br>
                            <input type="checkbox" name="priv" value="1" {{.priv}}>
                            <font face="arial" size="2">privately</font>
                            <select name="action">
                                {{.action-list}}
                                <br><br>
                            </select>
                            <select name="whoto">
                                {{.users-list}}
                                <br><br>
                            </select>
                            <input name="says" type="text" size=110>
                            <input type="submit" size=30 value="send"><br>
                            <a href="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/exit&user={{.nickname}}&id={{.session-id}}&exit=1&" target="_top">exit</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </form>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </body>
            <script>function setfocus() { document.forms["banner"]["says"].focus(); }</script>
        </html>
```

The link connecting at ``http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/exit&user={{.nickname}}&id={{.session-id}}&exit=1&`` is used for doing a gracefully exit.

The ``JS`` function ``setfocus()`` is just a trick in order to set focus to the ``says input`` by default.

The ``image input`` originally has the type ``select`` but this sample has no support for images. If you want to put support for this you should use:

```html
        <select name="image" size=1>
                                <option value="">image:</option>
                                {{.image-list}}
        </select>
```

and the server your handle it.

### The room's skeleton

The room is composed by three templates: ``top``, ``body`` and ``banner``. When a user request these, only one document is replied, this document can be understood as the skeleton (Does ``frameset`` scare you?). The room's skeleton puts all relevant parts together.

```html
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>Now you are talking on "{{.room-name}}"</title>
            </head>
            <frameset rows="30,*,75">
                <frame name="TOP" src="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/top&user={{.nickname}}&id={{.session-id}}&" scrolling="no">
                <frame name="BODY" src="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/body&user={{.nickname}}&id={{.session-id}}&" scrolling="yes">
                <frame name="BANNER" src="http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/banner&user={{.nickname}}&id={{.session-id}}&" scrolling="no">
            </frameset>
        </html>
```

It is important add to the frame ``src`` field the ``user`` (``{{.nickname}}``) and ``id`` (``{{.session-id}}``) otherwise it will never be loaded correctly.

### The exit template

When the user requests the virtual document from:

```html
http://{{.servername}}:{{.listen-port}}/exit&user={{.nickname}}&id={{.session-id}}&exit=1&
```

This user is trying to do a gracefully exit. When a gracefully exit occurs the server replies to the requester a document notifying this exit operation.
Yes, the document replied is based on exit template.

Inside this template you can use anything from the special markers that  you want to. However, the usage of some markers has more sense than others, of course.

This following content could be used as an ``exit template``, look:

```html
<html>
    <frame>
        <body>
            <center>
                <h1>Goodbye, "{{.nickname}}"!</h1>
                <small><i>connection closed.</i></small>
            </center>
        </body>
    </frame>
</html>
```

You could reuse the join template in replacement, too.

### The actions templates

These templates are used in order to format the chat room's messages. Indirectly in this kind of template, the usage of some
special markers are pretty important, otherwise nothing will be shown/said on your chat room. This is one sample of an ``action
template``:

```html
<p>({{.hour}}:{{.minute}}:{{.second}}) <b>{{.message-colored-user}}</b> <i>{{.message-private-marker}}</i> {{.message-action-label}} <b>{{.message-whoto}}</b>: {{.message-says}}
{{.message-image}}
<script>
    scrollIt();
</script>
```

Do you remember that inside the ``body template`` we had defined an ``JS`` function responsible for auto scrolling? So, here
we are defining that all received message will try to scroll the message window. This is just a trick. The rest of the content
I think is pretty clearer. It is only about the use of ``special markers`` related on user's messages. Go back to the ``Table 3``
if you have no idea about some marker.

### The highlight template

This template is used in order to (oh God!) highlight personal messages from others. Here, the only ``special marker`` that
you should use is the ``{{.current-formatted-message}}``. For instance, the template could be something like:

```html
<p><table bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="100%" cellspacing="0" border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>
            {{.current-formatted-message}}
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

# Running the sample

Probably you have seen that the original repository counts with a configuration sample. This sample is based on
``Opening your first chat room`` section present in this documentation. The files are inside the subdirectory named as ``sample``.

Supposing that you have a ``Cherry`` binary inside the subdirectory ``bin`` (with same level of ``sample``), being inside
``sample`` just try this:

```
doctor@TARDIS:~/web/git-hub/rafael-santiago/cherry/sample# ../bin/cherry --config=conf/sample.cherry
```

Note that you will able to access this room locally. Now, from your web browser you should access:

```
http://localhost:1024/join
```

An entrace form should be spit to you. Go ahead, fill up what it requests and that is all folks!

Something like this:

![Sample](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/cherry/blob/master/etc/sample.gif)

# New stuff from version 1.2

Now you can serve your rooms under ``https`` connections. The steps for getting it configured is pretty straightforward.

Firstly you need to create a certificate, in this case let's create a self-signed certificate:

```
doctor@TARDIS:~/web/git-hub/rafael-santiago/cherry/sample# mkdir cert
doctor@TARDIS:~/web/git-hub/rafael-santiago/cherry/sample# cd cert
doctor@TARDIS:~/web/git-hub/rafael-santiago/cherry/sample/cert# openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.crt
```

Now you have ``mycert.key`` and ``mycert.crt`` inside ``cert`` sub-directory.

The second step is about indicating the file path of this data inside your server configuration. So, at your ``cherry.root``
section add the following additional conf sets:

```
    cherry.root (
        servername = "mylocalchatserver"
        certificate = "cert/mycert.crt"
        private-key = "cert/mycert.key"
    )
```

All done! Now your server uses ``https`` instead of ``http``.

**Important**: If some previous defined template uses ``http`` it will not work properly. The trick here is always use
``{{.proto}}`` instead of putting hardcoded the url scheme (http or https). On this way you can switch easily from
a unsecure to secure server and vice versa. The sample that you can find at ``sample/...`` is shipped in this way.
There you will find too a sub-directory named `cert`` and inside of it you will find a suggestive script called
``mkcert.sh`` ;)

After running ``mkcert.sh`` all you should do is edit ``sample/conf/sample.cherry`` and uncomment ``certificate`` and
``private-key`` sets.

In this case we have a self-signed certificate, so the explicit acceptance of it at the client host is necessary.
